# **Welcome to our Hiking API!**

## Team HikingGroupRocks

_There's beauty in nature and in coding_

### How to use this app ###

Update your config.py file with your USERname, HOST location and PASSWORD: 
[Config file here](docs/config.py)

Then run the app file: 
[App file here](docs/app.py)

Then run main.py: 
[Main file here](docs/main.py)

This app will display a list of available dates to book our glamping site. It will then ask if the user has an ID already.

If the user exists, it will retrieve their name and prompt them to make a booking.

If the user does not already have an ID, it will take in their details (name and email), add these to a customer table and then prompt them to make a booking.

## _Here you can book our beautiful glamping site in the heart of Aviemore!_

We are using GitHub in this assignment to remotely share code that we've been working on, including the use of branches to prevent conflicts and enable rollback if needed.

### The first three tasks we had to complete were:
- [x] Create a repository 
- [x] Add collaborators 
- [x] Create branches and work on code :+1:


### Here are some screenshots of us using git: ###

Getting git status:
![Git status](https://github.com/Nicolakirk/hiking_api/assets/149243261/ce48a9e8-e966-4f7a-9729-7feab12ea9a2)

Adding, committing and pushing updates from the branch, then checking out to the main branch:
![Git add commit push checkout main](https://github.com/Nicolakirk/hiking_api/assets/149243261/4b7cf1ac-3ebf-48ac-9585-3874b1fd9dd1)

Pulling from main, deleting an old branch, checking out a new branch:
![Git pull delete branch checkout new branch](https://github.com/Nicolakirk/hiking_api/assets/149243261/e42fe54d-efba-40bf-9b7d-f6038c6e7b5b)
